<p>
This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It
is intended for use with client-side Javascript applications that make
use of HTTPRequest to perform server communication functions - data can
be encoded into JSON notation for use in a client-side javascript, or
decoded from incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to
Javascript, and can be directly eval()'ed with no further parsing
overhead.
